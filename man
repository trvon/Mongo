DEPLOY


NAME
		Deploy's mongodb hosted on node server


SYNOPSIS
		deploy [option] [url]


DESCRIPTION
		This script randomizes the port and secret contained within the app/$foobar/bin folder, 
		which hosts the application. Users can download multiple API's and launch them with the 
		(get) command or use current downloaded API's with the (use) command.

		The path's are relative, so it is advised to launch the deploy command within the top directory, espically after launching it for the first time. After the first launch the 
		target directory should contain an app folder and an data/db folder path

OPTIONS
		get		downloads a git repository into the app folder and then launches the app as 
				well as it launches a mongo databse. 

		use 	uses a current directory to launch an api from. Users can either use an URL to
				the directory or they can use the basename of the folder.
