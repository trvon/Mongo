NAME
       deploy - Automated npm project launch with mongodb dependency

SYNOPSIS
       deploy [option] [project] [name]
       - deploy setrepo [name]
       - deploy start [option]
       - deploy stop [option]
       - deploy update [option]
       - deploy get [url]

DESCRIPTION
		This script randomizes the port app/$foobar/bin folder, 
		which hosts the application. Users can download multiple API's and
		launch them with the (get) command or use current downloaded API's with
		the (start) command.

		The path's are relative, so it is advised to launch the deploy command
		within the top directory, especially after launching it for the first
		time. After the first launch the target directory should contain an app
		folder and an data/db folder path
